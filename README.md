Purposefully Vulnerable Solidity Smart Contract for Educational Purposes
💡 **VulnerableContract: Solidity Smart Contract with Intentional Vulnerabilities** 💻

VulnerableContract is an open-source Solidity smart contract repository designed to provide developers, auditors, and security enthusiasts with a practical learning resource for identifying and understanding common vulnerabilities in smart contracts. 🔒

📋 **Features:**
- Contains intentional vulnerabilities commonly found in real-world smart contracts.
- Each vulnerability is clearly documented and commented within the codebase. 📝
- Ideal for educational purposes, training workshops, and security analysis. 🎓
- Facilitates hands-on experience in identifying, exploiting, and mitigating vulnerabilities.
- Supports the use of popular security analysis tools and scanners. 🛠️

🔐 **Vulnerabilities Included:**
1. Lack of input validation (SWC-101) ❌
2. Reentrancy (SWC-107) ⭕
3. Unchecked Call Return Value (SWC-114) ❓
4. Use of Deprecated Solidity Functions (SWC-105) ⚠️
5. Unprotected fallback and receive functions (SWC-116) ⚙️
6. Insecure Randomness (SWC-114) 🔀
7. Unprotected Ether Withdrawal (SWC-118) 💸
8. Integer Overflow or Underflow (SWC-101) 🔄

🚨 Please note that these vulnerabilities are intentionally embedded for controlled testing purposes only. It is crucial to exercise caution when using this code and to avoid deploying it in production environments. 🛑
